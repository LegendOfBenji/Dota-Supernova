    <p class='content'>Dota 2 is one of the most popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games today, as well as one of the most played titles
    on Steam, Valve Corporation’s digital game distribution platform. It is considered a “core” title in the esports
    industry, with many major and minor tournaments held each year—including the multi-million dollar world championship The
    International. This zoomable sunburst graph is a homage to the top 10 teams in 2019 as well as offers the option to show the starting statistics
  of some of the most popular heroes in the game. Enjoy!</p>
